# GCandPython

This repository has the contents of a Python Workshop designed for analysis of GEOS-Chem. The repository contains small amounts of data, code for processing the data, and jupyter notebooks used to present the material.

This will always be a work in progress, but currently is particularly so. Not all materials have been uploaded.
